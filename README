JAGS WIENER MODULE
The JAGS Wiener module is an extension for JAGS, which provides wiener
process distribution functions, mainly the Wiener first passage time
density. It allows to include stochastic nodes with the first hitting time
distribution of a diffusion process.

EXAMPLE
In a model file, you can use:

x ~ dwiener(alpha,tau,beta,delta)
 
With the parameters:
  - alpha being the boundary separation parameter
  - tau being the non-decision time
  - beta being the bias
  - delta being the driftrate

There is also a second distribution:

x ~ dwieners(alpha,tau,beta,delta,1)

with the last parameter as standard deviation of the drift process.

And there are two logical nodes:

  - dwiener(x, alpha,tau,beta,delta)
  - dlogwiener(x, alpha,tau,beta,delta)
