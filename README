JAGS WIENER MODULE
The JAGS Wiener module is an extension for JAGS, which provides wiener
process distribution functions, mainly the Wiener first passage time
density. It allows to include stochastic nodes with the first hitting time
distribution of a diffusion process.

EXAMPLE
In a model file, you can use:

x ~ dwiener(a,ter,w,v)
 
With the parameters a,ter,w,v:
  - a being the boundary separation parameter
  - ter being the non-decision time
  - w being the bias
  - v being the driftrate
