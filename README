JAGS wiener module
==================
The JAGS Wiener module is an extension for JAGS, which provides wiener
process distribution functions, mainly the Wiener first passage time
density. It allows to include stochastic nodes with the first hitting time
distribution of a diffusion process.

Example
-------
In a model file, you can use:

x ~ dwiener(alpha,tau,beta,delta)
 
With the parameters:
  - alpha being the boundary separation parameter
  - tau being the non-decision time
  - beta being the bias
  - delta being the driftrate

There is also a second distribution:

x ~ dwieners(alpha,tau,beta,delta,1)

with the last parameter as standard deviation of the drift process.

And there are two logical nodes:

  - dwiener(x, alpha,tau,beta,delta)
  - dlogwiener(x, alpha,tau,beta,delta)

to calculate the (log-) density at value x.

Known Issues
------------
* Loading of the JAGS Wiener Module does not work (so far reported only by mac users).

  4 reasons for this issue are possible:
  - In MAC OS X the Versions of JAGS and the JAGS Wiener Module have been
    compiled for different MAC Versions (e.g. Leopard and Mavericks)
  - File permissions of the library files are wrong.
  - The library files are installed in a different location than the JAGS
    installation.
  - The library files have been compiled with a different gcc version than
    the JAGS installation.
  
  The easiest way to solve this issue, is by removing both, the JAGS and
  JAGS Wiener Module installation. Afterwards, recompile and install first JAGS,
  then the JAGS Wiener Module. If the same gcc version and the same
  installation procedure have been used, it should work.

For more Information on compiling also check the JAGS installation manual.
