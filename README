JAGS WIENER MODULE
This is a JAGS Module, which provides wiener functions. These can be used,
in the model definition, to include nodes, which are distributed as a
wiener process.

With the parameters a,ter,w,v:
  - a being the boundary separation parameter
  - ter being the non-decision time
  - w being the bias
  - v being the driftrate
